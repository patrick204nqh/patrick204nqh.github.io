*Insights on software development, data science, and more.*

### Background

I started my journey in the tech world by studying Information Technology at university. Although I didn't complete my degree, I gained practical experience through an 8-month internship with Ruby on Rails. This hands-on experience paved the way for my professional career. I worked at an outsourcing company in Vietnam, contributing to various projects and gaining valuable industry experience. Currently, I work as a Backend Developer for a Canadian product company, developing and maintaining scalable web applications.

### Mission

The mission of this blog is to share insights and knowledge on software development, data science, and career development. I aim to provide valuable content that helps fellow developers and tech enthusiasts learn new skills, stay updated with industry trends, and grow in their careers. Whether it's through tutorials, best practices, or project showcases, I hope to contribute to the tech community and inspire others to achieve their goals.
