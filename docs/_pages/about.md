Welcome to my blog!
<br/>
Iâ€™m Huy Nguyen, a software developer passionate about building scalable web applications and continuously learning new technologies. With a strong foundation in backend development, I specialize in Ruby on Rails, Laravel, and other modern frameworks.

### Background

I started my journey in the tech world by studying Information Technology at university. Although I didn't complete my degree, I gained practical experience through an 8-month internship with Ruby on Rails. This hands-on experience paved the way for my professional career, where I now work as a Backend Developer for a Canadian product company. Over the years, I've worked on various projects, from developing HR platforms to creating personal websites and mobile applications.

### Mission

The mission of this blog is to share insights and knowledge on software development, data science, and career development. I aim to provide valuable content that helps fellow developers and tech enthusiasts learn new skills, stay updated with industry trends, and grow in their careers. Whether it's through tutorials, best practices, or project showcases, I hope to contribute to the tech community and inspire others to achieve their goals.
