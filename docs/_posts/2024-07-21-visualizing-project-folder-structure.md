Visualizing the main paths, folders, and files of a project can be incredibly helpful for creating documentation and assisting other developers in understanding the project structure. In this post, I will show how to use the `fd` and `tree` commands on macOS and Linux to list a project’s folder structure while excluding certain files and directories that don’t need to be seen, like `.git` and `node_modules`.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have `fd` and `tree` installed on your system.

### For macOS:

If Homebrew is not already installed, it can be installed with:
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Then, install `fd` and `tree` using Homebrew:
```bash
brew install fd
brew install tree
```

### For Linux:

Install `fd` and `tree` using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, run:
```bash
sudo apt-get install fd-find tree
```

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Generate a List of Directories Excluding Common Patterns

Use `fd` to generate a list of directories, excluding common patterns such as `.git` and `node_modules`. This keeps the directory structure clean and focused.

```bash
fd --type f --type d --hidden --exclude .git --exclude node_modules > folders.txt
```

### Step 2: Create the Directory Tree Structure

Use `tree` to create the directory tree structure from the list generated by `fd`. This command visualizes the project’s structure up to a specified depth.

```bash
tree -L 3 --fromfile folders.txt
```

- `-L 3`: Sets the maximum display depth of the directory tree. Adjust the number `3` based on your needs.
- `--fromfile folders.txt`: Reads directories from the `folders.txt` file.

### Step 3: Clean Up

Remove the temporary file used to store the list of directories.

```bash
rm folders.txt
```

## Optional: Create a Bash Script

To make this process even easier, automate these steps by creating a Bash script.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Generate the list of directories excluding common patterns
fd \
  --type f \
  --type d \
  --hidden \
  --exclude .git \
  --exclude node_modules \
  <-- Add more here -->
  > folders.txt

# Create the directory tree structure
tree -L 3 --fromfile folders.txt

# Clean up
rm folders.txt
```

### Save the Script

1. Save the script to a file, e.g., `list_structure.sh`.
2. Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x list_structure.sh
```
3. Run the script:
```bash
./list_structure.sh
```

## Conclusion

Using `fd` and `tree` with these steps or script, it is easy to visualize a project’s folder structure while excluding specific files and directories. This approach provides a cleaner and more focused view of the project's layout, making it easier to write documentation and for other developers to quickly get up to speed with the project.

Feel free to adjust these steps based on the project’s specific needs. Happy coding!
